# Organization and the Repositories status

Currently, this product is in a process of transitioning from an internal to an open-sourced project, which is still
work in progress:dizzy:. Gradually we are pushing one component after another to the public: sources to the GitHub, JVM
artifacts to the [&rarr;Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ccom.github.ebaydatameta), Ruby Gems to the
[&rarr;Ruby Gems Central](https://rubygems.org). We have not located suitable home for our Python eggs yet, this is 
TBD.

Therefore, you may find many links that point nowhere (because for some there is still nowhere to point),
some contradictory and unclear wording, even empty repos like the [&rarr;Examples, for instance](https://github.com/eBayDataMeta/DataMeta-examples).
And you will see them filling up, some faster some slower as we keep managing our priorities.

We would also add the following documentation here:

* Quickstart.
* Overview of all repositories and where to find what.
* Issue tracking including bug reports, feature requests, clarifications etc.
* Contributing guidelines.

And more.:truck:
